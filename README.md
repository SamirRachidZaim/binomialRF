binomialRF R package

The binomialRF package is an R package that provides a feature selection algorithm to be used in randomForest classifiers. Treating each tree as a binomial stochastic process in a random forest, binomialRF determines a featureâ€™s importance by how often they are selected in practice vs. as expected by random chance.
