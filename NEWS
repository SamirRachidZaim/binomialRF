Future work:

* Implement theoretical results for model averaging

* Improve and expand visualization techniques

* Expand to pathway and network-analysis capacities

binomialRF R Package 0.99.1

* The binomialRF is a novel feature selection technique for decision trees that aims at providing more interpretive and statistically significant feature subsets using binomial distributional assumptions. Treating each splitting variable selection as a binomial process, binomialRF then tests whether a feature is selected more often than by random chance.
