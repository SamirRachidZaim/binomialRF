Description: The binomialRF is a new feature selection technique for decision trees that 
    aims at providing more interpretive and statistically significant feature subsets using binomial
    distributional assumptions. Treating each splitting variable selection as a set of exchangeable correlated bernoulli trials,
    binomialRF then tests whether a feature is selected more often than by random chance.
